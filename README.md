##  Overview

This project is a **high-quality real-time stock market prediction system** developed using Python. It fetches live stock data from the Alpha Vantage API, processes it with Pandas and Statsmodels, and builds predictive models using Scikit-Learn.

Designed for accuracy, speed, and usability, this tool is ideal for traders, analysts, and AI enthusiasts aiming to leverage machine learning for financial forecasting.

##  Features

-  Real-time live stock data fetching via Alpha Vantage API  
-  Data preprocessing & feature engineering with Pandas  
-  Predictive modeling with multiple ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA)  
-  Easy configuration & extensibility for different stocks  
-  Clean, modular, and well-documented Python code  
-  Command-line interface with clear outputs  
-  Ready for integration with trading bots and dashboards  
-  Dark mode UI (planned for future GUI release)  
-  Export predictions to CSV or JSON files  
-  Fully coded from scratch â€” no pre-trained models used!

##  Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arad-nafarieh/real-time-stock-predictor.git
   cd real-time-stock-predictor


# Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Get your free Alpha Vantage API key from Alpha Vantage and set it in the .env file:

ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


# Run the main script to start predicting:

python main.py --symbol AAPL --interval 5min --output predictions.csv


Parameters:

--symbol: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)

--interval: Data fetch interval (1min, 5min, 15min)

--output: File path to save predictions

ðŸ“Š How It Works
Fetches live stock data from Alpha Vantage API

Cleans and preprocesses data using Pandas

Trains predictive models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA)

Outputs next-period stock price predictions

Saves predictions to specified output file
